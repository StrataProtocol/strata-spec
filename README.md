# Strata Spec

This repo contains the canonical specification for the Strata Protocol:
cryptographic identity, provenance, relay behavior, and the client-side
Reality Tuner model.

## Structure

- `whitepaper/strata-protocol.md` — narrative + high-level spec.
- `rfcs/` — incremental, focused design documents for specific pieces.

## Status

Early draft. Expect breaking changes.

## Contributing

1. Open an issue describing the change.
2. If it’s non-trivial, write an RFC under `rfcs/`.
3. Open a PR for review.
